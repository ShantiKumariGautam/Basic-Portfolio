            <p>Hi! I'm Shanti Kumari, a prefinal year student at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University. I'm pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering. I have a strong passion for web development and I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, and DSA. Currently, I serve as a Junior Executive in Event Management at both the IEEE IGDTUW and the AI Club IGDTUW. In this role, I have successfully managed numerous events, including drone workshops, hackathons, and seminars featuring prominent speakers.</p>

I am passionate about leveraging technology and fostering innovation, and I thrive in environments that encourage creativity and professional growth.

            I also have a keen interest in web development, and I am proficient in C++ and data structures and algorithms. Outside of my technical pursuits, I enjoy expressing my thoughts through poetry.</p>
